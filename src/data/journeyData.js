      "In 2nd grade, my teacher asked what we wanted to be. My best friend said 'Software Developer.' I copied him. An innocent act, yet somehow, that word stuck. It was the first, unwitting step towards a path I'd truly own.",

      "First year of college, big dreams. We paid â‚¹27,000 for an e-commerce site... built on WordPress. The startup crashed, and so did the website. It broke me financially. But that sting taught me something invaluable: If I'm going to build, I'll build it MYSELF.",

      "Today, I'm not just writing code; I'm building real projects like VibePair, helping others, and chasing curiosity. I want to write code wellâ€”with focus, consistency, and pride. Because I'm not just here to be a developer. I'm here to become a GREAT one. It took longer than planned, but I never stopped moving.",
